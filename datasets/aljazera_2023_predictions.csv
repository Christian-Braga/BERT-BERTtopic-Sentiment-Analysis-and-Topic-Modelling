"firstly , it ’ s tragic what ’ s happening to innocent people on both sides and one can only hope for things to get better as meek as it seems . however , what i find so h is people being so blind to the centuries of atrocities that have been committed by israel against palestinians in their own native lands and all along for the most part the world being so silent about it especially the western world . for those of you that have been unaware or intentionally ignorant about the palestine and israel issues , these flare ups have been happening for centuries from both sides initiating the attacks . but do you truly expect people to not resist when you op them in their own land and build a fall of “ israel . ” i find it truly laugh how everyone thinks this is because of just hamas . this particular attack , yes . but where was was the world when over 250 palestinians were killed last year , over 28 of which were children . why did no one talk of that act of terrorism ? why was everyone so silent and uncomfortable with getting “ political ” ? the white man has been violent and inhuman throughout history yet has always painted an innate violent image of all groups of people they have op . we have seen this clearly with colon and slavery . let ’ s be honest and clear that the root cause of all these problems is because of settler colonial . because of israel . and honestly , things will only get worse when people intentionally blind themselves from the root cause . all of these would not have happened have they never occupied palestine in 1948 . there would be no resistance groups such as hamas if palestinians were free in their own land . free palestine ! ! ! ! !",0,0,2023-10-10T15:47:49Z,0

"when we study the israel palestinian conflict , and we put ourselves in a short and non - historical perspective , we cannot help find reasons for sympathy for those who is holding prisoners in a huge concentration camp and against whom the theft of their land by settlers is organized , and for others who feel threatened in their existence as a people and as a country . but , if we want a definitive settlement of this permanent conflict , we cannot ignore history . in fact , all parties to this conflict have a pressing interest to settle even if they are not yet aware of it , except of course the united states for whom des regions benefits its he . geo is changing at a speed never seen before seen in modern history and soon the alliances that gave rise to this conflict and that maintain it will be shifted so that today ' s winners will be tomorrow ' s losers . the anglo - american empire which is at the origin of the conflict will disappear and israel will find itself without an ally in the middle of an arab - muslim sea . today israel is counting on its nuclear weapons to protect itself but tomorrow iran and others will have acquired the same weapons and israel will be faced with the obligation of hearing each other or destruction . if israel wants to negotiate the new regional order from a position of strength , it must do it today because tomorrow it will be too late since concessions will be extracted from it by force . the only possible basis for negotiation for a lasting peace is the creation of an independent palestinian state , including illegal settlements created on land stolen from the palestinians . returning these settlements in full and in good condition to the palestinians will demonstrate the sincerity of the israeli and their willingness to live in peace and in harmony with their neighbors . to achieve this , israel will have to break the will of the ex in its camp who believe that this country has all rights and that others have none . in a long - term perspective it is obvious that such a policy if not contained , will lead the country to destruction as was the case on several times in its history . israel has the right to exist but will only exist by recognizing the same right to other peoples . when you are powerful , the attempt to crush rather than ne is strong but history has demonstrated that the enemy only come out strong . the ball is therefore in israel ’ s court but time is playing against this country .",0,0,2023-10-10T13:34:58Z,1
