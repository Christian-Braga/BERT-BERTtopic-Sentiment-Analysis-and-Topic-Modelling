"God of Abraham Isaac and Jacob will defend his children of Israel God will not be mocked

Psalm 83
King James Version
83 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.

2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.

3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.

4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:

6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;

7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;

8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.

9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.

13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.

14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;

15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.

16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord.

17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:

"Benjamin Netanyahu is engaging in ""Collective Punishment"" which Adolf Hitler showed can be an effective very tool. Expect him to level Gaza by the time that this is over. As for the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, he doesn't care that they are dying in the air strikes on Gaza. As the greater the Collateral Damage to Israel, the greater the ""Collective Punishment"" Netanyahu can dish out to Gaza. 

Put another way, if Israel truly wanted peace, they would not treat the Palestinians as good for cheap manual labor, and Palestinian land as growing space for Israeli development. Under these conditions, there should be no surprise that Hamas has so many young men willing to die for their people.

"Firstly, it‚Äôs tragic what‚Äôs happening to innocent people on both sides and one can only hope for things to get better as meekly as it seems. However, what I find so hypocritical is people being so blind to the centuries of atrocities that have been committed by Israel against Palestinians in their own native lands and all along for the most part the world being so silent about it especially the western world. For those of you that have been unaware or intentionally ignorant about the Palestine and Israel issues, these flare ups have been happening for centuries from both sides initiating the attacks. But do you truly expect people to not resist when you oppress them in their own land and build a fallacy of ‚ÄúIsrael.‚Äù I find it truly laughable how everyone thinks this is because of just Hamas. This particular attack, yes. But where was was the world when over 250 Palestinians were killed last year, over 28 of which were children. Why did no one talk of that act of terrorism? Why was everyone so silent and uncomfortable with getting ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù? The white man has been violent and inhuman throughout history yet has always painted an innately violent image of all groups of people they have oppressed. We have seen this clearly with colonisation and slavery. Let‚Äôs be honest and clear that the root cause of all these problems is because of settler colonialism. Because of Israel. And honestly, things will only get worse when people intentionally blind themselves from the root cause. All of these would not have happened have they never occupied Palestine in 1948. There would be no resistance groups such as Hamas if Palestinians were free in their own land. FREE PALESTINE!!!!!",0,0,2023-10-10T15:47:49Z,0

This is all a sham. Israel has been been taking more and more from Palestine every year, and now it's about to finish it. On top of that, we're supposed to believe that Israel, the country that's in top 20 on army ranking needs ""help"" to attack Gaza. Also, somehow, some rockets have managed to penetrate one of the best defenses on the world, and literally everyone on Israel's side is avoiding that question of how was that possible. Apparently the cause of this war is not important, the important thing is destroying Gaza, because they must pay for not being able to take the oppresion anymore, after 75 years.

Many Palestinians want peace and stability with autonomy from Israel. 
  My heart hurts for 2/3 of the Palestinians who are prisoners to Israel and radical Islamist! Even the moderate Political organizations in Gaza are basically squashed and persecuted. So you have a very difficult task of dealing effectively with Hamas whilst giving tools to moderate political factions for getting their message across and support for a palestinian state that has diplomatic strategy to help Palestinians people find a way to achieve sovereignty in a nonviolent manner that doesn't involve Iran or radical islam ideology. The latter statement of non-radical ideology will be the hardest one to overcome cause Hamas/Iran will try to destroy opposition and Israel will not allow a Sovereignty movement to succeed on world stage. But you will never have peace without a two state system in Israel... Palestinians need a country of their own and I believe If concessions were taken with Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon  to carve out a better border between them and built security systems in place well before expansion or relocation of Palestinian settlements. It would require worldwide economic support and a inventive of economic growth for those countries with a large scale development construction project and gives Palestinians hope. It would also require a significant amount of vetting for the citizens, companies, and politicians of Palestinian's to be involved in the development process. So no Islamic extremism would be allowed in those areas with regard to settlement of those newly developed areas. To be a sovereign nation you have to have a form of police and military... But if the entire world came together saying we will not impede your security and sovereignty within the borders of your country. So limited army would be a concession for Palestinians. this would be a viable alternative to what ever is available now.

How then does it have tares?‚Äô 28 He said to them, ‚ÄòAn enemy has done this.‚Äô The servants said to him, ‚ÄòDo you want us then to go and gather them up?‚Äô 29 But he said, ‚ÄòNo, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. 30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, ‚ÄúFirst gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.‚Äù ‚Äô ‚Äù",0,0,2023-10-10T15:13:03Z,0

Perhaps it is best to offer the Olive Branch & pursue the Peace Path. Once the Israeli-Gaza border has been secured by the IDF and Gaza bottled up then Tel Aviv may offer an armistice. Terms of the armistice: In exchange for not launching a ground incursion into Gaza all the hostages and bodies shall be returned. Any mediation and potential peace talks thereafter may occur between the State of Israel and the Palestinian authority with potential Gaza representatives at future talks for maintaining Gaza-Israeli peace & security being conditional upon suitable arrangements between the principals of the Palestinian Authority and the State of Israel. 
The goal of the armistice is simply humanitarian as to preventing further civilian suffering on both sides.

They love to hide behind the hospitals, the schools, anywhere they can hide to pretend that their civilians are being killed innocently. America sent billions of dollars the past 20 years to help the Palestine government to build hospitals, schools, water treatment plants, etc. The UK has done this too and France and many other Western Christian countries to help them out. What did their government do with the money?? They built tunnels to pop up into Israel, they bought guns and arms, etc. They didnt help their own people, they helped their cause of hate to destroy and kill, its terrible but true. Did the Palestinian people tell their government to stop this and truly help them, that money was for them. Nope, they didnt. In Australia the Palestinians were gathering there to shout death to Israel and shame on Australia for supporting the ONLY Democratic country in the Middle East. Same thing in Berlin except the police rounded them up and stopped them. Nobody wants terrorists in their country. Unfortunately, Palestine did this to themselves. Israel has always defended themselves and never actively attacked or went on the offensive because its against the laws of God. However, it is very clear in the Old Testament which outdates the Quran by 5,400 years. It states that if you are attacked so badly that a war has been declared on you, you must fight back and put an END to it. After Sept 11th we had to go to Iraq and Afghanistan. It shocked the Middle East but then they realized that you shouldnt pick a fight with someone who is stronger, smarter, and will defend its people if need be. It was stupid of Hamas to video everything they did on Saturday and put it LIVE on the internet. The whole world saw for themselves the children, the babies, and people who were Asian, American etc. taken captive or killed just for standing on Israeli land. Thats how much hatred Hamas had that they couldnt even distinguish between a Jew and a Gentile. Hopefully, other Muslim nations will be willing to take in refugees from Palestine, but lets be honest.... Nobody wants terrorists in their country. So hopefully some wealthy country in the Middle East will have mercy on the true civilians caught up by the actions of Hamas and will help them find a new home. However, there are YEARS of footage of the Palestinians saying, ""death to Israel, death to America, death to Great Britain, death to the West"". When you are that hateful and doing the work of Satan, how can you expect people to help you or feel sorry for you when you have just declared how much you hate everybody else but yourselves???  Not too many countries are crying for Palestine, not even Saudi Arabia who also has many terrorists living there. As the days go on, i dont think too many countries will come help Palestine. This could be the end of that country and those people will have to move. The Bible says, ""the sins of the father"".... this means if your parents or grandparents do something sinful, it will affect their children for years to come. As days go on, I truly believe not many countries will be wanting to help Palestine because we all know that most of the kidnapped civilians are most likely dead. Very few are still alive. Hamas just says that they are alive because now they desperately want the bombing to stop but i havent seen too much footage of those kidnapped people still alive, has anyone else?? Everyone knows the moment they were kidnapped, that was it. They were dead, basically, because Hamas is not kind hearted. They want to annihilate and kill everyone that isnt Muslim. Countries that are tired of Muslim terrorists, we are tired of them. Its time to just put an end to these crazy people and either put them in prison til the day they die or execute them. Its very expensive to imprison that many people who are terrorists and why should peoples taxes be used to house and feed people who are serial killers???",0,0,2023-10-10T14:21:21Z,0

"Targeting your opponent's innocent civilians, killing them, taking them hostage and even torturing them has been used as a war strategy ever since human civilization began. Organized crime groups also use this strategy to try and get what they want.  All major nations have done this in the past, including the US but in the 21st century many of the developed world nations have resisted in doing this intentionally. To add to the tragedy, in retaliation to the terrorist attacks,, civilians on the same side as the terrorists that  are innocent and do no support the terrorists will also be killed.  

The groups and the countries that continue to do this in the 21st century whether its  Al Qaeda, ISIS, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Taliban or Russia are continuing to show the world how depraved cowards try to solve conflicts. This is who terrorist are. Depraved cowards with no morals or ethics. They want to solve their conflicts by fighting wars but they do not want to face their opponent's army. They want to go kill and torture their opponent's civilians and don't even care about their own civilians. Hamas certainly does not care about Israelis but Hamas does not even cares about Palestinians. I Hope the Palestinian people that live Gaza or in other parts of the world do not support Hamas and speak out against this terrorist organization that are destroying any chance of peace between Palestinians and Israelis.  Terrorism has never worked in solving a conflict!

Hamas actually knows that killing innocents civilians in the 21st century will  not solve their conflicts and grievances with the Israelis they just do it because this is what they think is worth dyeing for and this is what they want to be known for and justify this by believing that their supernatural magical authority that lives in the sky is supporting them and will be looking after them, taking care of them and even rewarding them after they die and if they die by suicide they think they will get even a bigger reward.",0,0,2023-10-10T13:57:31Z,0

IF ISRAEL WANTS TO NEGOTIATE THE NEW REGIONAL ORDER FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH, IT MUST DO IT TODAY BECAUSE TOMORROW IT WILL BE TOO LATE SINCE CONCESSIONS WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM IT BY FORCE. THE ONLY POSSIBLE BASIS FOR NEGOTIATION FOR A LASTING PEACE IS THE CREATION OF AN INDEPENDENT PALESTINIAN STATE, INCLUDING ILLEGAL SETTLEMENTS CREATED ON LAND STOLEN FROM THE PALESTINIANS. RETURNING THESE SETTLEMENTS IN FULL AND IN GOOD CONDITION TO THE PALESTINIANS WILL DEMONSTRATE THE SINCERITY OF THE ISRAELI AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO LIVE IN PEACE AND IN HARMONY WITH THEIR NEIGHBORS. TO ACHIEVE THIS, ISRAEL WILL HAVE TO BREAK THE WILL OF THE EXTREMISTS IN ITS CAMP WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS ALL RIGHTS AND THAT OTHERS HAVE NONE. IN A LONG-TERM PERSPECTIVE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT SUCH A POLICY IF NOT CONTAINED, WILL LEAD THE COUNTRY TO DESTRUCTION AS WAS THE CASE ON SEVERAL TIMES IN ITS HISTORY. ISRAEL HAS THE RIGHT TO EXIST BUT WILL ONLY EXIST BY RECOGNIZING THE SAME RIGHT TO OTHER PEOPLES. WHEN YOU ARE POWERFUL, THE ATTEMPT TO CRUSH RATHER THAN NEGOCIATE IS STRONG BUT HISTORY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ENEMY ONLY COME OUT STRONG.

"YOU HAVE TO BE TERRIBLY BLIND NOT TO SEE THAT THE ISRAELI OCCUPANT A TERRITORY WHICH DID NOT BELONG TO THEM AND THAT WITHOUT THE COMPLICITY OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN EMPIRE THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE MANAGED TO MAKE IT A STATE.

THE ONLY COMPARISON THAT MATTERS IS THAT OF THE GERMANS OCCUPANCING FRANCE AND WHOM TERRORISM ADDED TO THE WAR SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING OUT. THAT SAID, WE NEED TO BE REALISTIC AND SEEK A SOLUTION IN COMPROMISE THAT THE ISRAELI HAVE NEVER WANTED TO CONSIDER. THE CREATION OF A PALESTINIAN STATE WILL TAKE PLACE WITH OR WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF ISRAEL. SO IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER THAT IT BE DONE WITH THEIR HELP AND EVEN WITH THEIR COLLABORATION SO THAT THIS STATE IS PROSPEROUS AND RESPONDS TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF HONEST PEOPLE WHO ONLY ASK TO LIVE FREELY A SIMPLE AND HARMONIOUS LIFE.

"Just read a post on terrorist attack by Hamas, a girl at the concert, laying on ground  hiding under a truck for HOURS was found & killed.  The terrorists spent HOURS going back and forth over concert area & parking lots making sure they killed ever possible concert goer they could.
Given this & other actions, killing & taking hostage as human shields women, children, grandmother's, makes this ""attack"" nothing more than pure sadism.
From a country that swore to wipe Israel & it's people from the face of the earth & joined 4 others to repeatedly attempt just that.
Israel told everyone in Gaza to leave while they target anyplace Hamas ever used.  The Egyptian border is at most 50 km away.  I assume Egypt would welcome back it's subjects with welcome arms, having ruled Gaza from Arab Nations 1948 war against UN division of area into Arab & Jewish areas which was apparently the first effort to separate the two warring groups, until losing it in Arab countries failed 1967 war.
NO ONE IS REPORTING that world court is currently hearing a case against Israel for illegal occupation which it is likely to loose, as at the least, many of the actions of it's more militant population has certainly violated international agreements governing occupied countries.  At the least this is likely to result in VAST REPARATIONS from Israel to 100,000s of Palestinians.  Even the US would be hard pressed to deny many of the claims. 
Israel already lost at least one case over walk construction, though that didn't lead to any ability of individuals to use decision in cases against Israel, the only likely way Palestinians can obtain redress.  As the occupation is a result of their repeatedly attacking Israel.  It is essentially legal, subject to constraints.  No nation will go to mat on the basic legality, but will probably abandon Israel when decisions about it's actions since.  Especially over individual provable excesses.  
So
Why would Hamas on the brink of international victory at the very least give Israel & uta supporters decades more to feel morally justified to ignore such an  international decision for decades more?
Of course nothing in Mid East makes any sense.

"FACTS 
Mr. Poilievre, Prime Minister Trudeau and other leaders and opposition leaders in the world: Remember that fighting and destroying HAMAS means also killing Palestinians. The Palestinians voted in HAMAS as their official government in recent years. The sons and daughters of Palestinians have joined HAMAS directly and or support them. There are many innocent and peaceful Palestinians suffering, but many of them have a hard time leaving Gaza. Israel wont let them in and other countries wont let them in. Many Palestinians don't want to leave Gaza, but instead continue the fight against Israel. Anyone that says HAMAS is not made up of many Palestinians is either ignorant or lying. HAMAS is funded by other countries including and mainly Iran. HAMAS pays Palestinians to work for them. Many Palestinians who are stuck in GAZA in a dead end situation, take the money from HAMAS and join their ranks. Many Palestinians who don't support HAMAS have to turn a blind eye to HAMAS activities around them because they are terrified of HAMAS, and they know their own people are part of HAMAS and all around them. It is not enough to wipe out HAMAS. It is also important to give the portion the Palestinian community who are innocent and peace loving a way out of poverty and hopelessness.

Yesterday Hamas murdered and kidnapped hundreds of civilian women, children, elderly men and women. 
The attempt to draw false equivalency between Saturdays surprise attack and targeting of civilians to the response by Israel is self serving nonsense. You get
 the leaders you support. Palestinians unfortunately keep electing corrupt and radical leaders who stoke hate and keep the status quo because it keeps them relevant and in power. Every time over the past 40 years Palestinian sovereignty has been on the table, two state solution supported by the entire civilized world, the Palestinians rejected it and prefer to remain the victim and  complain about occupation.

28 This prophecy came in the year King Ahaz died:

29 Do not rejoice, all you Philistines,
    that the rod that struck you is broken;
from the root of that snake will spring up a viper,
    its fruit will be a darting, venomous serpent.
30 The poorest of the poor will find pasture,
    and the needy will lie down in safety.
But your root I will destroy by famine;
    it will slay your survivors.

31 Wail, you gate! Howl, you city!
    Melt away, all you Philistines!
A cloud of smoke comes from the north,
    and there is not a straggler in its ranks.

"The historical context reveals that the formation of an independent state within the former Mandate of Palestine, akin to the establishment of Israel, was an option to the Arab population in the area. However, the leadership decisions of the time led the Arab population down a different path, one that prioritized the destruction of Israel over constructive nation-building efforts. Consequently, instances occurred where they seized any available opportunity to launch attacks on Israel, obliging Israel to respond in defense of its territorial integrity and its right to exist.

Today's globalized economic landscape is based on cooperation among nations. Even Arab states have recognized that the future lies in collaboration rather than repeating a cycle of retaliation fueled by fundamentalism. This acknowledgment has prompted several Arab nations to normalize their relations with Israel. Furthermore, they have begun to question the viability of the Palestinian cause as represented by entities like Hamas, as they recognize the potential for blowback within their own territories. Organizations with ideologies akin to Hamas are increasingly deemed unacceptable within their borders.

The current barbaric act against civilians in Israel has fully revealed the true barbaric nature of  Hamas leaving no doubt that this could mark the beginning of the end for Hamas and the Gaza Strip as we know it today.",1,0,2023-10-10T09:37:56Z,0

"In short: the Israelis have invaded the state of Palestine in 1948 (just like how Russians invaded Ukraine now) and Israelis justified that as their religion (2500yrs ago) states its their land and they must take it!!!,,, therefore, in 1948 the Israelis with full support of US and UK with militarily force took Palestinians  land, homes, farms and resources, and kicked them out of the own country and squeeze them to small areas (now known as Gaza strip and west bank) and blockaded them by air/water and land for 75 years,,,,  so it is logically expected that the people of Palestine will fight to gain back for their land which is now occupied by Israelis just like how Ukrainian‚Äôs fight for their occupied land‚Ä¶. ‚Ä¶Western double standards supports Ukrainians to liberate their occupied land but on the contrary support Israel to continue occupying Palestinian‚Äôs  land‚Ä¶‚Ä¶",0,0,2023-10-10T09:36:50Z,0

"RE HINDUTVA IDOLS IN JEWISH BIBLE: 
""I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the Lord."" Psalms 31:6 
""Their idols are silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths, but do not speak; eyes, but do not see. They have ears, but do not hear; noses, but do not smell. They have hands, but do not feel; feet, but do not walk; and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them; so do all who trust in them.""  Psalms 115: 4-8

""Cursed be the man who makes a carved or cast metal image, an abomination to the Lord, a thing made by the hands of a craftsman, and sets it up in secret.‚Äô And all the people shall answer and say, ‚ÄòAmen."" Deutronomy 27:15",0,0,2023-10-10T09:35:45Z,0

"What is that ceasefire for? When Hamas terrorists were killing people in Israel, these Muslim countries were celebrating, they did not utter a single word for Israel. Today they are left breathless after seeing Gaza being turned into a graveyard.
Now Israel is not going to stop, it will turn Gaza into a graveyard and will come back only after sending Hamas to 72 Hurons.
The whole world is watching the duplicitous character of these Muslim nations.
Israel will not stop, turn entire Gaza into ashes.",1,0,2023-10-10T09:28:39Z,0
