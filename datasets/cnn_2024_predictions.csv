"the massacre of october 7 demonstrated that handing over gaza to the palestinians in exchange for peace was a mistake . the indo ##ct ##rina ##tion of the population in gaza and the west bank , for generations , has created a society of violence and hatred against israelis and jews , causing different waves of terrorist attacks and cruelty against civilians . if you ask palestinian civilians on the streets , only a minority supports israel , the majority of them want the destruction of the israeli state . if you ask the israelis , however , the majority want peace . so what to do ? whose responsibility is it to generate peace ? an entire society would have to be re - educated . if israel does so , it would be state intervention ##ism , and would threaten the self - determination of the palestinians . will the palestinians themselves or the un institution un ##r ##wa , responsible for that same indo ##ct ##rina ##tion of death and destruction , do it ? i don ' t believe it . so , rather than discussing the solution , we should pre ##cede what is going to happen , israel is obliged to re ##take gaza , in this war , and convert it into sovereign territory , and under its total control . and if they attack israel from the west bank , there will be a war with the west bank and it will end in the same way as gaza . and all under international laws on war . the second important thing about this conflict is that the majority of palestinian mil ##ita ##rized groups , who advocate eliminating the state of israel , and creating "" a palestinian state "" by force , and who obviously sub ##ju ##gate their own population , "" the palestinians "" , under an islamic fundamental ##ist religious dictatorship , have been financed , organized and trained by other islamic countries , such as egypt , syria and iran , that is , they are not really palestinian nationalist political forces . so , how legitimate the palestinian nationalist movements really are , and if this palestinian identity really is , it is nothing more than a smoke ##screen to cover up the total ##itarian interests of the islamic brotherhood to dominate all the territory in its path and its population ? in the end , let ' s be realistic , and let ' s not hide the truth , and let ' s not try to see something else that is not . gaza was an israeli territory that had good economic activity and was prosperous , and was handed over to the palestinian authority in 2005 , the israeli population was forced to withdraw completely , so that it could be developed together with zones a and b of the west bank , the desired state . palestinian , without jews , and in 2007 , under democratic ##ally elected elections , hamas became the government , they murdered the opposition , and anyone who did not support the regime , including the christian palestinian population , and since then gaza was transformed into a military base iranian . and this supported by civilians and their "" palestinian "" leaders . so , gaza is not actually part of the palestinian state , it is part of the state of iran , and its population that voted for it and supports it , does not actually have a palestinian identity , but rather an iranian or islamic one .",1,3,2024-08-21T16:16:55Z,1
