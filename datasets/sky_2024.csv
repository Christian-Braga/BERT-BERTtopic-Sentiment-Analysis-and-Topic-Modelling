Under the Roman Empire, Gaza experienced relative peace and its Mediterranean port flourished. In 635 AD, it became the first city in the Palestine region to be conquered by the Rashidun army and quickly developed into a centre of Islamic law."" NETANYAHU'S AGGRESSIVE QUEST FOR REVENGE DESTROYED IT AND IT'S ANCIENT HISTORY IN LESS THAN 3 WEEKS!

War of vengeance  will not solve the problem. Look at how decimated the city has become. This should be a lesson to any terrorist organization planning attacks to a country that have 100x man power than them. My heart goes to the Gaza people that have to go through this because of a handful of people who only think about themselves and their lost cause.,2,2,2024-10-06T17:17:09Z,0
