"The massacre of October 7 demonstrated that handing over Gaza to the Palestinians in exchange for peace was a mistake. The indoctrination of the population in Gaza and the West Bank, for generations, has created a society of violence and hatred against Israelis and Jews, causing different waves of terrorist attacks and cruelty against civilians. If you ask Palestinian civilians on the streets, only a minority supports Israel, the majority of them want the destruction of the Israeli state. If you ask the Israelis, however, the majority want peace.   So what to do? Whose responsibility is it to generate peace? An entire society would have to be re-educated. If Israel does so, it would be state interventionism, and would threaten the self-determination of the Palestinians. Will the Palestinians themselves or the UN institution Unrwa, responsible for that same indoctrination of death and destruction, do it? I don't believe it. So, rather than discussing the solution, we should precede what is going to happen, Israel is obliged to retake Gaza, in this war, and convert it into sovereign territory, and under its total control. And if they attack Israel from the West Bank, there will be a war with the West Bank and it will end in the same way as Gaza. And all under international laws on war. 

The second important thing about this conflict is that the majority of Palestinian militarized groups, who advocate eliminating the state of Israel, and creating ""a Palestinian state"" by force, and who obviously subjugate their own population, ""The Palestinians "", under an Islamic fundamentalist religious dictatorship, have been financed, organized and trained by other Islamic countries, such as Egypt, Syria and Iran, that is, they are not really Palestinian nationalist political forces. So, how legitimate the Palestinian nationalist movements really are, and if this Palestinian identity really is, it is nothing more than a smokescreen to cover up the totalitarian interests of the Islamic Brotherhood to dominate all the territory in its path and its population?

In the end, let's be realistic, and let's not hide the truth, and let's not try to see something else that is not. Gaza was an Israeli territory that had good economic activity and was prosperous, and was handed over to the Palestinian Authority in 2005, the Israeli population was forced to withdraw completely, so that it could be developed together with zones A and B of the West Bank, the desired state. Palestinian, without Jews, and in 2007, under democratically elected elections, Hamas became the government, they murdered the opposition, and anyone who did not support the regime, including the Christian Palestinian population, and since then Gaza was transformed into a military base Iranian. And this supported by civilians and their ""Palestinian"" leaders. So, Gaza is not actually part of the Palestinian state, it is part of the state of Iran, and its population that voted for it and supports it, does not actually have a Palestinian identity, but rather an Iranian or Islamic one.",1,3,2024-08-21T16:16:55Z,0

They are used to skirmishes and thought that the world would come to tie Israel's hands when the war went south for them and they cried victim. They have Israeli citizens in their borders, kidnapped from their daily routines and lives to be used as insurance to tie the hands of Israel. Israel has said enough!

This was used to build TERROR TUNNELS for murdering innocent civilians and yet not a single 'innocent Gazan civilian' was allowed to have refuge in these underground tunnels where kidnapped hostages are held against their will.

An ancient religious minority, the Yazidis have for centuries faced persecution due to their faith. The self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and Syria  attacked Sinjar, the northern Iraqi Yazidi homeland. 

More than 400,000 Yazidis fled their homes and tens of thousands took refuge on Mount Sinjar where they remained stranded and hungry for weeks. Over 3,000 Yazidis, mostly men and elderly women, were killed, and around 6,000 women and children were captured by ISIS. The captive women and children were targeted for sexual slavery and trafficking, while the boys were trained to fight for ISIS.

"'40,000 Palentinans killed' which these numbers are reported by the Health Ministry in Gaza, who is run by Jihadist ISIS-HAMAS is like believing when Joseph Goebbels, the chief Nazi propagandist for the Hilter's Nazi Party, publicly said in a press conference that 'only a few hundred Jews died in Auschwitz Poland,' while being held in concentration camps during WW2!!!! By the way, CNN as you report now, are you even aware that thousands of born and raised Muslim Afghans are being forcely expelled, beaten and deported from Pakistan, taking their possession of homes and properties and they have no where to go because they fear returning to Afghanistan due to the Totalitarian Taliban Regime!!!! Unfortunately, these poor Afghans are camping out in tents without anyone donating and airdropping any food or water and their children are dying of hunger, but sadly, since Muslim persecutions on other Muslims seems to be perfectly fine with the Western woke mentality like yours, while thousands of Afghans children are dying of starving but the  WORLD prefers to remain silent!!! 👿  However, when Jews decide to defend themselves and refused to remain passive and not let themselves be slaughtered as sheeps, like in the past History ...then the world cries a 'counterfeit genocide' for Palestinians, who have been launching thousands of rockets into Israel since the establishment of ISIS-HAMAS aka formerly Muslim Brotherhood and the intifada uprising since 1987!!!!!!",1,0,2024-08-18T03:04:39Z,0

"If you're claiming this as a ""genocide"", you're essentially saying that Hamas, Hezbollah, none of the 15 or so Muslim countries in the Middle East, or any of the 2 billion or so Muslims in the world today, are doing anything meaningful to stop it. You're also saying that Israel is apparently so incredibly powerful that it can go in, kill no one but 100% civilians, leave Hamas completely unharmed, and get away with it because a quarter of the world's population won't dare step up and try and defend the Gazans who are being ""genocide"" out of existence.

Did I miss anything here?

BTW in actual fact the IDF has the LOWEST civilian to terrorist kill ratio in the entire world, and given Hamas' spectacular collapse militarily throughout 2024 I'm pretty sure their numbers would figure greatly amongst the total death toll figures. Unless you're suggesting Hamas are simply cowering underground, clutching their weapons and their body armour, and letting ""evil"" Israel wipe out their own population in Gaza?",1,0,2024-08-17T00:09:52Z,0

Jewish property not destroyed became occupied by Jordanians. After the Israeli victory in 1967 and Jordnian disillusionment with their expansion effort (1988), Jordan revoked the Jordanian citizenship of ""palestinians"" in Judea & Samaria (known as the west bank by MSM) and east Jerusalem.

They knew that if they massacred 1200 Israelis and kidnapped hundreds more, Israel would defend itself, dismantling 350+ miles of underground tunnels, destroying weapons and hunting down fighters. They couldn't not do what needed to be done even if Hamas did the cowardly thing and fought among civilians or had command centers among civilians, to try to up the casualty count.  Hamas diverts food and aid. And we don't know the real casualty count.  We have already seen the tricks played with the casualty numbers.

"This is called, what do we really want people. We all, are seeing this world, spiraling out of control. This has been for years and it's gotten worse. Seems to me, the only way we are going to solve these issues is by, banning together and speaking out more. Speaking out more too, your elected officials. Saying too them, I demand too see better life changes, in our every day living. That includes, every neighborhood in the United States of America. Express too them, we deserve better, for our nation of people. Start by, making Americans more accountable, too stay in linemen with,  Americans policies. By holding people, more  accountable for their wrong doings. Fairness for all and more accountability from us all. Mercy should only fall upon those, that surely has mental disabilities. If we start by, making people more accountable, for their actions. Then maybe, we all will fall in line with, what and how too follow rules. We need too start by, weeding out the bad and replacing them with responsible individuals. Someone that's good, but knows how too follow the rules. That means law enforcements, in every aspects. Whether they're low or high in any positions. That really needs too address, about its no  tolerance. Letting people know, things can't proceed with, people engaging in wrongful acts. Especially people's actions, that are not in line with the public dealings. They're a high risk out there, working against our American public. They're messy and they got their hands in, all kinds of people's money's and stuff. I urge our leaders to investigate people like this and sentence them, like they would  do anyone else. By paying close attention to matters as this, will let the next know,  they won't get away with such action. Those that want too be a public figure or working to man over our public. Please do your jobs right because, believe me, AI is coming for your job's. Believe me, they will do your jobs and more and It's not going to be pretty. But I'll assure ya'll, it's going to solve a lot of issues, putting those robots out too watch the public. People wondering why, they're building  more jails, for people that don't know how to act. Get ready because, some of you are really off the chain and ya'll really need too be off those streets.  Some of y'all need too, really get ya'll actions together now, before AI comes about.Believe me, the programs that they will install, will sense everything about you. They're not going to be playing with ya'll out there. Our public really needs to see change and if it's going to take that robot, then oh well. People will then understand why,  things has too be right.  This is for those, that are keeping a watchful eye on all of us. Learn too follow the rule book for yourself, as well as, giving orders too others. Sentencing  comes with great responsibilities, being fair to all, not just some. Letting some off, only made matters worse for someone else. It won't save a life and it won't put someone in a bad predicament. For all that's been working in the system, stealing and helping yourself too other people's money's and stuff. The system will get you as well, corruption will catch up too ya'll, as time will stamp. They'll  Eventually have something in place, too calculate all your wrong doings. For ya'll too, there we be AI'S, looking into everything ya'll been doing wrong. Now think about that jail cell, you won't like.  People get your actions in tactic, life is going too catch up with your actions, sooner or later.  I worked for many of law enforcements, for many years. Including for the federal government and I had to make good decisions, in whatever I did. This is so, I wouldn't get in trouble or brought up on charges for anything.  But a lot of my co-workers did, that cost them jail time and their jobs. Can y'all see my point and this vision coming soon, I know I do. Reality sits well with me, what about ya'll. Please ya'll, stand with me, on all theses issues. And believe in the vision, as too where this country can really go. I'm saying, if we all just stand together on these issues, then we will see progress. Things will get better, if we all work hard in getting it done. Please urge your elected officials, too start making theses changes, in all United states. Understand, we have too follow the rules. Helping too keep our neighborhoods clean, and understanding that our environments, is important too our future. Being more concern in about our neighborhoods, encouraging others in doing the same. I know,  I stay on people, that live in my house. Keep trying too make them understand that, our outside environment needs too be cleansed, as well as the inside of our homes. We suppose too care and help keep it clean. I don't understand why, some just won't see that, as something important. If we don't  make trash a priority, it can really build up on you, really fast. Then before you know it, you got a lot of trash around you. After having a home fire and having to throw everything outside, waiting for that dumpster too come. I know what it's like, looking at a lot of junk, around your property. But some of you got so much junk, around your properties that, it doesn't look good to your neighbors. My town, they used to pick up a lot of our big bulk stuff. But now, they don't want to haul anything but trash and recycle for us. Which is now making it hard on people, too pay for their own big bulk pick UPS. Things like, TV's, furniture, woods and other home bought items. Which now is putting a big burden on, people in my town. Those that can afford, for a company too pick up they're bulky items. I rather for the city's, too take responsibilities in. Picking up such things, this is so, we won't have any illegal dumping. Then we will have a, bigger problem, now who wins. I would hope that, our leaders would start making better decisions and all governors see to it.  Helping them to enforce better decisions, for our city's. Now, when it comes too property owners. We pay taxes, based on certain things that's,   happening in our towns. But yet, theirs a lot of cutting back and  issues, that's being forced on homeowners. Things we feel, should be taken care of, by our city. Things our city's are suppose to take care of, but they're slowly pushing the weight off on us. Understanding that, making better decisions, will make great city's. Always putting the cost back on, the American people's pockets after those taxes were taken. The weight is bearing down and I don't know how much people can take this anymore. Supporting everyone out of United States and not enough in United States. We need all tax dollars, for problems in America. You can't take care of people and you can't take care of your own. Stop swinging the door wide open, for just anyone to come here.  My neighborhood is being bombarded with people, that's not even registered here. They're sneaking in by the droves and pale up, in theses houses like pack rats. Paying theses property owners, tons of money, just too live in a small portion of that property. Crowding my neighborhood, like it aint  funny and divining America jobs up, between themselves. Americans want good pay, for their hard labor, that's all they're asking.   Haven't american people out of their,  given enough of our pockets, paying into taxes. Taxes are being taken for things, that's supposed to be about this and that. But our country is turning around and making us pay for that and then some. Cutting back on us, more each day. Yes Joe Biden did, try too help people get some things. But more needs to be done, in paying share far of taxes. My city, act like, they didn't take taxes us for certain things already. Now I see why, drugs an alcoholic, is not an issue. Being blind won't hurt, is a easier target. Speaking out will help them too understand, things needs too get better. Stop thinking, that, things will work itself out. They won't, if people don't speak up. Stop being friends with everyone and do what we voted need ya'll to do. Some of y'all out there, are taking money and favors for, things ya'll know better about. Our leaders know how they supposed to be, setting an good example, for others too follow by. Being responsible for, all that's in the United States of America. With everyone helping too make that happen, believe me, it can be done. Helping too clean up this environment, that is all of our jobs and holding those accountable. When you train people, in the right direction, that's where they will go. But if you don't, head them in the right direction, watch them destroy somethings. Don't get mad at the messenger, jump on board and let's make this happen. Soon, we'll have a fresh start again, with a new president. One with good morals and integrity. One that seems loving and kind, but hopefully, willing too get the job done. Someone that really cares about all Americans, not just some, but all. Ya'll know who I'm talking about, I'll just let y'all decide on that. Younger and not crazy, who I'm talking about. Ya'll have a blessed day and I'm talking too everyone out there. 🙏❤️😏👌",0,0,2024-08-15T20:07:17Z,0

"These comments are really apalling. Due to the conditions of the occupation, 47% of Gaza's population is made up of children, too young to have voted Hamas in 20 years ago in 2005. Either way, these are innocent civilians that have been killed in the retaliation - if Israel or Netanyahu had any restraint or discipline at all they could've preserved public favor and eliminated Hamas commanders in a more specific manner, but instead they're bombing schools, hospitals, and residential safe zones, killing dozens and sometimes hundreds of innocents just to get to a few Hamas operatives, all while playing into their hand and turning the entire world against them. The genocide isn't even popular IN ISRAEL, since Netanyahu appears willing to sacrifice the hostages and thousands of civilians just to maintain political power. There's a reason the ICJ put out arrest warrants for Hamas AND Netanyahu, and that's not even considering the blatant illegality of the Israeli government's settlements in Gaza and the West Bank. This whole affair is a very transparent land grab, and if Netanyahu gave a shit about the hostages or Oct 7, it would've been over long ago.",0,0,2024-08-15T18:48:38Z,0

"Fake new CNN the number 40,000 just like everything else how and from who can you prove this number? 
This number is Nonsense and come from the same terrorist from October to 7th🤬.
The last time I checked HAMAS in the US is under “terrorist list/blacklist”- FACT… I can speak for my own eyes how many times I have seen make up artist fake ambulances, and groups rushing with the same person over and over and over which any person with common sense will ask if the person is dead why are they running and if he’s injured why am I seeing the same person over and over again? 

When you hide under your children, beds, weapons and grenades RPG ‘s You are a member of Hamas - the house next door under the children bed when you lift it will have enter to tunnel shift…. That makes you Hamas member — I am not speaking from watching CNN or watching Fox News only from my experience with my eyes that am sharing facts - remind everyone first how this all started and remind them that they are still at American hostages and three of them are not with us no longer rest in peace🙏🏻… and every attempt to negotiate it’s getting more ridiculous and ridiculous if they are 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza and there were 40,000 member of Hamas /Islamic Jihad - ask yourself who are those people in House there are the same people that is showing in the footage they got elected and they have over 93% full support🤬….

When a commander member of Hamas who captured said and I’m quoting “ we did not imagine that Israel/IDF will come with us this strong with that force” 💥…

When you pray for rain, you have to deal with the mud too and just like there’s not gonna be a deal with the hostages they  don’t know where the hostages are and the idea will not stop until Gaza will not be any threat to the Jewish state… And for anyone who’s gonna read this there are Arabs Israeli, who fighting in Gaza including units with Muslim Arabs Israelis soldiers That protecting their homes, their country🇮🇱….

CNN is just like Al Jazeera just like the BBC we can add CNBC NBC  as their  days are numbered ♟️…  

“ we do know that the majority of that number is from women and children” anyone with common sense and logic would ask himself how’s that possible that over 3500 members Hamas Surrendered- and over 22.000+ members are with their virgins which they are not sure if it the US virgins all the UK virgins🎤…

The three reporters from CNN like Wolf are in Jerusalem, reporting about if or when I ran in Israel will go to war…

Can you trust CNN?  Can you trust a woman that was the only Hamas elected member ever due to the fact that she videotape putting suicide vest on her three children that’s what they called them at age 16 17 took them on a bus to Jerusalem and watched them blowing themselves innocent people- when she was ask if she was SAD - she said that she’s got 8  more that ALLHA gave her so she can have a seat with the top terrorist of Hamas.

"Hey man…this is the fault of the government they voted in and STILL overwhelmingly support based on recent polls taken inside Gaza. They support Hamas’s tactics of rape, brutal murder, torture, suicide bombings, taking hostages, killing babies, etc…..basically they all believe in using the most abhorrent methods you can think of. It’s a medieval mindset. Cutting off peoples heads? Give me a break with this. The Palestinian population is the most radicalized Muslim population on earth. If Palestinian sympathizers would just read the Quran and Hadiths…..their whole world view on this issue will be turned upside down. It is divinely mandated in those books (furthered by the prophet in the Hadiths) to convert, subjugate, or kill ANY non believer but specificity the Jews. The Jews get very special attention in those books. This is not about…nor has it ever been about land, or “human rights”, or an “oppressed people”. 🙄 If you think that you literally know nothing about this topic. You also can not hope to apply your western values and sensibilities to the Middle East. It’s the wrong metric for this equation and you’ll get a dangerously wrong answer every time.

"The Gaza health ministry is run by Hamas. You are literally taking these numbers from actual terrorists. Furthermore, Hamas (which is supported by Iran, the Houthis and Hezbollah) is known for forcing Gazan civilians into the line of fire for PR purposes. They place no value on human life, believing these poor folks, who are raised from birth to hate Jews and Israel unconditionally, to be martyrs.

Other Middle Eastern countries are loathe to accept Gazan refugees because they don't want to accept the risk of also accepting Hamas terrorists, as they have their own issues with Islamic terrorism. Israel is correct in saying that Hamas entrenches themselves in the civilian population. They're human shields.

The root of this problem is ultimately Islam and its antisimetic teachings. As someone who was raised in Islam, I can affirm that it is a dangerous cult that must be phased out.",2,0,2024-08-15T16:08:01Z,0
