"There's is no Palestine. The word palestina was given to the land of Israel by the roman empire because it hated the Jews who were there before any arab. There's no such a place as west bank, its ""Judea and Samaria"". All of gaza ""It's territory legitimately conquered by Israel in 1967"" it is JEWISH LAND!!. By thousands of years of history, heritage, and by promiseI. It is the heartland of their biblical history. Jewish is an ethic group, is a religion, is a culture, is a Nation.

"It goes further than the excellent Al Jazeera analysis. The century-old Israel-Palestine Conflict is certainly about land. But I agree that 7 October was not. Between Bibi's 29 December 2022 victory speech promising to expand settlement construction and then annex them into Israel, and Itamar Ben Gvir (Bibi's fundamentalist Jihadist Minister for National Security) February 2023 promise to force 'revenge' on those who resisted, between those dates and 6 October, Israelis killed 342 West Bank citizens, nine of them murdered by settlers. What death toll did Hamas have to tolerate before striking back? Another 500, 1000, 5000? Remember that in mid-2014 we in the West tolerated Israel's slaughter of ~2200 Gazans because 3 settler teens were murdered. 342 not justification versus 3 was? Is that not a wee bit unbalanced ... a wee bit overtly racist? The Hamas invasion and the IDF genocide in Gaza did not start on 7 October, but on 29 December 2022. Now we all know who triggered it. And 7 October was just one link in the chain-of-events, not the 'start'. So why does this come as a shock revelation? I can tell you. A BS Western mainstream media terrified of being labelled as anti-semitic.

While it's possible that the media may have exaggerated certain aspects, nothing justifies the killing of innocent people who were attending a festival or those desperately hiding in a bunker, only to have grenades thrown inside. There is no justification for such actions, yet it seems that Al Jazeera omitted this part of the story.

I have a lot of time for Al Jazeera but to portray this an an unbias investigation is laughable. No mention in the preamble as to why Israel thought it necessary to build a wall in the first place (Hamas have a long history of mass murder of the civilian population pre-dating 7th Oct).  No mention that the attack was carried out at the behest of the Iranians to scupper Israel's chances of signing the then imminant peace deals with many of its muslim neighbours.  No mention that the savagery of the attack on civilians was calculated to provoke the harshest response from Israel (again to scupper hopes of a lasting peace deal). Essentially Hamas carried out the attack for Iran KNOWING they would be scarifying 1000's of their own people but they did so anyway because they have NO INTEREST in making a peace deal with Israel or creating a two state solution. No mention that Netanyahu backed a two state solution in 2009 and the Palestians rejected it because they are only interested in Jewish genocide. Until the UN and all the western liberals get that through their thick skulls Israel has every right to defend itself.,1,3,2024-11-15T23:02:01Z,0

"""Palestinians lived there for millenia"" as per Ahmad ALNAOUQ, Co-found, ""We are not Numbers"".  What a nonsense to listen to the Hamas terror apologist like him - the name ""Palestinian"" was invented only in the year 1964 when an EGYPTIAN opportunist named Yasser Arafat, paid by the Muslim Brotherhood, raised a JORDANIAN flag (minus the little star - it had to look a bit different, right) and declared sudden thousand year history of ""Palestine"". Before 1964 they just called themselves Arabs, as in Syrians, Egyptians, Jordanians, Lebanese, etc... They always had a country go to. Jews did not. Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan expelled 900,000 (!!) Jews from there countries after 1948, duh, they lost everything, their land, houses, property - but they left, relocated like millions of other displaced people after war. Did those 900,000 Jews in retaliation bomb, massacre, kill, kidnap torture their neighbours from Arab countries???? Of course not. They are not savages.

Monstrous. Crimes against humanity. Pure evil. There is no excuse for this. And let's not forget, Israel offered the Palestinians a state in 2000 and they TURNED IT DOWN. I weep for all the Palestinians children who have suffered because their adults have chosen terrorism over diplomacy. The greatest problem the Palestinians have is their own leadership. They are their own worst enemy. And now look at what has become of Gaza! Its piles of rubble. Murder begets destruction. No good came of this. Only more pain, more sorrow, more hatred. It is easy to tear down. It is not easy to build up. Until Hamas is totally destroyed, there will be no chance for the Palestinians to chart a new course.

"Was this video put out by Al Jazeera or the IDF? The estimate of total Palestinian debt is wildly understated. Only the bodies of people who have gone through the hospital system are counted as dead when at least ten times more than that number are left lying under the rubble or died from malnutrition and other causes.
The alleged operation appears to be a false flag on its face, worse than Pearl Harbor. The number of Hamas fighters can fairly reach fifty souls according to the home videos. The military base that was invaded had already been deserted and one of the soldiers said so. The few people left sleeping in their beds were killed but conquering an empty facility is hardly a military victory. All the people at the festival were communists and liberals, despised by the Likud party and were set up just days before the event when the venue was changed to the Gaza border.
Forty-two survivors of the Nova Music Festival in the land on October 7 have sued, placing responsibility on the Israeli government for the tragic events of the festival. The lawsuit blames the Army for failing to notify concert organizers when signs of Hamas attack emerged late the night before, on Friday, October 6.
Calculating the number of civilians killed or ‚Äú1200 total dead.‚Äù
1200 total dead‚Äù
-700 military dead
500 civilian dead
-112 killed at Kibbutz Be'eri
-360 killed at the Music Festival
28 total civilians were killed somewhere else
The Apache pilots testified that they fired a massive amount of ammunition, emptied the ability of the helicopter in minutes, flew to rearm, and returned to the air again and again. These helicopters appear to have focused on vehicles streaming back into Gaza from the Nova Electronic Music Festival and nearby kibbutz, attack cars knowing that Israeli captives could be inside. They also fired on unarmed people exiting cars and were walking on foot through the fields on the periphery of Gaza.",0,3,2024-09-04T22:19:31Z,0

"Subject: Rebuttal on Historical Claims Regarding Palestine
Dear Ahmed Alnaouq
I would like to address the assertions made regarding the historical context of Palestine and the Palestinian identity, particularly in light of the well-documented video presented by journalist Ahmed Alnaouq. While I am not a journalist, I am an individual with a foundational understanding of history.
It is essential to clarify that the accusation of Israel's appropriation of land deemed as Palestinian territory for over a century reflects a significant misunderstanding of the historical narrative of the region and its peoples. It is worth noting that the term ""Palestinian"" as a national identity has evolved, and it is imperative to recognize that the concept of a distinct Palestinian nation, as understood today, is a relatively modern development.
Historically, the land known as Palestine was governed by the Ottoman Empire for approximately 400 years until the establishment of the British Mandate in 1917. During this period, various Arab tribes from regions including Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria inhabited the area. Furthermore, an examination of the surnames of many Palestinians residing in Gaza reveals a diverse heritage that ties them to these historical contexts.
It is also pertinent to highlight that since 2007, Gaza has been under the administration of Hamas, not Israel, which has implications for the socio-political dynamics of the region. Notably, over 150,000 Palestinians from Gaza have been granted work permits to work in Israel, and many Gazans have received medical care in Israeli hospitals and much more, the people of Gaza received from Israel over the years.

It is a well-established observation that journalists often highlight poverty and suffering, particularly in regions like Gaza, portraying the narratives of the Palestinian population as victims. However, it is crucial to recognize that this portrayal can sometimes inadvertently contribute to a justification of violent actions and terrorism, both in the eyes of the observers and within the broader context of global discourse.
While it is essential to shed light on the hardships faced by individuals in conflict zones, it is equally important to provide a balanced perspective that encompasses the complexities of the situation. A one-dimensional narrative risks oversimplifying the issues at hand, neglecting the underlying causes and the multifaceted nature of the conflict.

Before 1960, there were no recognized Palestinian government officials, and the notion of a cohesive Palestinian governance structure was not established until the formation of the Palestinian National Authority as an interim administrative body under the auspices of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) following the Oslo Accords of 1993. This raises pertinent questions about the historical presence and governance of a Palestinian state before this development.
I urge you to reconsider the historical claims made regarding the governance of Palestine or any historical connection of a nation of so-called Palestinians before 1960  who were they, what was their flag, and history. I would appreciate any evidence or sources you may have to substantiate your assertions about the Palestinian historical narrative and the claimed governance of the region.
Thank you for your attention üòä",1,0,2024-08-21T23:31:20Z,0

The resources of the country [Palestine] are still virgin soil and will be developed by the Jewish immigrants (...) we have seen the Jews from foreign countries streaming to Palestine from Russia, Germany, Austria, Spain, and America. The cause of causes could not escape those who had a gift of deeper insight. They knew that the country was for its original sons [abna'ihi-l-asliyin], for all their differences, a sacred and beloved homeland.

Or after witnessing the dead bodies at the music festival? Or watching as they kidnapped hundreds of innocent people?  Did everyone somehow forget about this and just start feeling bad for them?

"If you counted right, more than 750 unarmed civilians had been killed.
And when I see these pictures, how those men behave. ....I think the Palestinians have ruined their hope of an own State.
I always supported that idea, I took part in demonstrations.
But october the 7th proofed it wrong.
Gaza, after Israel left it and gave the territory to be ruled by the Palestinians themselves, it was a test to create something.
The international community gave millions every year to support this project.
But now it is completely failed. The one and only at least half free State, they ever had.
Instead of using this for creating a future for themselves, violence and terror.
What has happened with all these millions of money.
Why didn't they made fields growing like at the other side of the fence? Why didn't they build hotels at the beautiful beach?
Why didn't they tried to make an agreement with Egypt to open the boarder for tourists?
With all that money, where is it gone?
Weapons, tunnels.
That is not the right way to get help and respect by the international community.
What shall we think about poeple doing such crimes?

I understand this report is trying to relativate it. But there remains at leats 750 unarmed civilians murdered.
No matter if 2 or 20 children had been murdered. No matter if some were killed by the israelian side itself.
It stays as a horrible crime.

When three Israeli soldiers were released in Gaza, they were killed by the IDF as they walked toward them. Were they killed because they didn't want them to report that their request for help during the attacks were ignored???

"Facts that are crucial to that reporting.

- First violence against jews began 1920 before Israel was a thing.
- Palestinians first agreed to immigration
- Agression was never a goal for israel, rather defending
- Palestinians and the arab league essentially attacked altogether with the goal to elminate israel (real genocidal attempt)
- Israel never attacked unprovoked

"They do not live in overcrowded conditions there. In fact, the entire eastern side of Gaza is very spacious... There are many open areas, as you can see in the video itself where they held the protests in 2018.

They do not live in a prison. Their border with Egypt is always open, and they travel and tour the world...
They could always cross the border into Israel and get a work visa.
They did this and made a lot of money.
But some of them chose to use the work visa to gather information about Israel.

The kibbutzim were not established there because, at the time they were established, there was no border with Israel... There were settlements closer to Gaza.

"The Prophet Rael has declared that he‚Äôs the Jewish Messiah (Moshiach). In 1973 he was visited by an alien named Yahweh who explained that all life on Earth was created scientifically by scientists from his civilization (known to the Jewish people as ‚ÄòElohim‚Äô) They asked Rael for an embassy to be built so they can arrive officially. Moshiach Rael has denounced Israel for the genocide against the Palestinians. Moshiach warns that the survival of Israel hangs in the balance unless the state recognizes him as the long awaited Messiah. He has called on the Israeli government many times in the last 50 years to grant him a plot of land near Jerusalem to build the embassy which is the prophecised Third Temple. The Elohim confirmed on 6 August 2015 that they have withdrawn protection from Israel and you are seeing the fall out today. Rael had a second encounter with the Elohim on 7 October 1975, which is a Raelian ‚Äòholy day‚Äô that is celebrated every year. The Hamas attack on Israel occurred 7 October. A co-incidence?

"Very very misleading and biased. blatant manipulation of video in order to minimize the blame on Hamas and Gaza citizens that murdered and ravaged innocent civilians, and make Israel look aggressive while it was only responding to a vicious attack. 
Let us not forget El Jazira is not operating under a democracy and serves the narrative of its Masters. 
 
Just a few corrections:
Hamas does not aspire to end an occupation. There was no occupation in Gaza on October 6th. The Gaza Strip got more aid per capita than anywhere else in the world. What did they do with it? They built terror tunnels and bought materials for rocket launchers and weapons. There are many videos of them abusing bodies, just search for October 7th on Google. Be warned, it is very hard to watch!
Also, what is the definition of a 'child'? Hamas usually uses children soldiers aged under 18. Is a 17 years old soldier an innocent victim? How about a 16 years old with a rocket launcher?

Also, glossed over the violent murder of opposition, gays and anyone suspected of collaboration with Israel by Hamas, and their extreme Islamist ideology. 

The deaths of Gazan civilians is a tragedy, but the blame lies mostly with Hamas. If they had not attacked, those people would be alive.",0,1,2024-06-12T00:18:25Z,0

"I loved the documentary, but I also must comment on my disdain for whoever created the English subtitles for it. Nearly every single sentence spoken in English was rewritten. This was done even for the narration and those where English is their 1st language. It is not your job to rewrite what is actually said, but to relate exactly what was said. I am not a deaf person, but I do have a hard time understanding thick accents, so I use subtitling. I was appalled because the deaf deserve to hear the documentary just as it was spoken. One example: The word ""disturbing"" was used and the subtitle said ""worrying,"" which lended a completely different context.  And it was NOT to shorten sentences for easier read. The sentence lengths remain much the same. Shame on you.",6,0,2024-05-27T05:32:34Z,0

"I am asking out of ignorance. Are the kibbutz surrounded by military posts? Are the soldiers in these settlements the same who man the security towers over Gaza? So if it gets attacked by any military, civilians will be injured because they are inside a military base?
Then there is the army of Hamas. No military vehicles, no air support, and everything made from scrap, attack a fortified Israeli position. 
I always see 1139 Israelis killed on October 7th by Hamas, but no distinction as to how many were soldiers. Not all 1139 were civilians.
Lastly, Israel finds bodies in Rafah of civilians who died October 7th. What are the chances they had these bodies all along and kept them hidden until they could use them as propaganda in this war. Ask yourself, how did Hamas manage to keep these bodies up till now. Who does it benefit and, at the same time, calls to halt Raffah offensive are echoing around the world. 
What about the hostages taken by Israel in nightly raids in the West Bank since long before October 7th. 8500 plus since October 7th. Kids as young as 7 in military courts.
Is anyone still just trying to justify Israel? Release the hostages in Israel jails and the hostages held by Hamas. Oh, and Israel keeps bodies of dead Palestinians in prison.

God Promised Abraham that whosoever curses Israel he will also course those people and whosoever blessed Israel will be blessed also.

"*Zechariah 12:1-3(KJV)-The burden of the word of the Lord for Israel, saith the Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him. 2 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the people round about, when they shall be in the siege both against Judah and against Jerusalem. 3 And in that day will I make Jerusalem(THE SEAT OF ISRAELI GOVERNMENT) a burdensome stone for all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it.

*Jeremiah 16:15(NKJV)-15 but, ‚ÄòThe Lord lives who brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where He had driven them.‚Äô For I will bring them back into their land which I gave to their fathers.

Has a nation ever been born in a single day Has a country ever come forth in a mere moment? But by the time Jerusalem‚Äôs  birth pains begin, her children will be born. 9 Would I ever bring this nation to the point of birth and then not deliver it?‚Äù asks the Lord. ‚ÄúNo! I would never keep this nation from being born,‚Äù says your God.

*Ezekiel 36:9-11(NKJV)-9 For indeed I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be tilled and sown. 10 I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt. 11 I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall increase and bear young; I will make you inhabited as in former times, and do better for you than at your beginnings. Then you shall know that I am the Lord.

*Ezekiel 36:30-36(NKJV)-30 And I will multiply the fruit of your trees and the increase of your fields, so that you need never again bear the reproach of famine among the nations. 31 Then you will remember your evil ways and your deeds that were not good; and you will [a]loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your iniquities and your abominations. 32 Not for your sake do I do this,‚Äù says the Lord God, ‚Äúlet it be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel!‚Äù 33 ‚ÄòThus says the Lord God: ‚ÄúOn the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will also enable you to dwell in the cities, and the ruins shall be rebuilt. 34 The desolate land shall be tilled instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass by. 35 So they will say, ‚ÄòThis land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden; and the wasted, desolate, and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.‚Äô 36 Then the nations which are left all around you shall know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruined places and planted what was desolate.

They have no knowledge, Who carry the wood of their carved image, And pray to a god that cannot save. 21 Tell and bring forth your case; Yes, let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from ancient time? Who has told it from that time? Have not I, the Lord? And there is no other God besides Me, A just God and a Savior; There is none besides Me. 22 ‚ÄúLook to Me, and be saved, All you ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other. 23 I have sworn by Myself; The word has gone out of My mouth in 
righteousness, And shall not return, That to Me every knee shall bow, Every tongue shall take an oath. 24 He shall say, ‚ÄòSurely in the Lord I have righteousness and strength.

Open your eyes and see our despair. See how your city‚Äîthe city that bears your name‚Äîlies in ruins. We make this plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy. 19 ‚ÄúO Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and act! For your own sake, do not delay, O my God, for your people and your city bear your name.‚Äù

*Jeremiah 31:35-37(KJV)-35 Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; The Lord of hosts is his name:36 If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. 37 Thus saith the Lord; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the Lord.

*Genesis 22:15-18(KJV)-15 And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, 16 And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: 17 That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; 18 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.

Anyway,
1.Hamas made this attack to release the +7000 Palestinian hostages in Israel prisons in non humanity condition, so hamas is a reaction not action (they became +15000 now BTW)
2. the ppl in nove festival were soldiers or ex soldiers and we all saw how cruel the israeli soldiers are

4. regardless the military status now, but all the people in israel are land robbers, and the ppl of this land has the whole right to defend themselves and to do whatever required to get this land back, and as we saw, the peaceful resistance doesn't work, so there is no way except the armed resistance",1,0,2024-05-17T23:29:54Z,0

"If you can't see how slanted this coverage is, you lack a mind.  I've no doubt that Israel lied and exaggerated a lot of things, and we all know it should have been better prepared, and that their response to the attack no doubt killed Israeli civilians.  But come on!  Who is the guilty party in creating Oct. 7?  You show those horrific scenes of the slaughter of helpless innocents, and try to suggest that Hamas terrorism is justified, Israel to blame for it?  I'm not buying it.  And I'm not pro-Israel.  In fact, I am very sympathetic to the plight of Palestinians, and I know that Israel has been terrible to them.  But I would like to see Palestinians prosper in peace in the region holding autonomy, alongside Israelis.  The Oct 7 attack was NOT the way to that objective, no more than the Israeli response that it drew (and knew it would draw).  Slanted coverage like this does not help.  It's like blaming 9-11 on Bush's stupidity, weaknesses in airline security, and American foreign policy, while suggesting that the plane that went down in PA was likely shot down by us.  All of that might be perfectly true, but it doesn't in any way justify 9-11.  Shame!!",3,3,2024-05-16T16:30:10Z,0

1:02 ""These accounts were used to justify an assault on Gaza"" - Accounts ?  it's video taped.. Justification ?? - It's eventuality.. were they expecting cupcakes after roasting babies in ovens ?
1:07 ""31,000 civilians; 13,000 children"" - It's war, Hammas should have defended their civilians; they were hiding underneath in bunkers and tunnels

They had a full hour for the video, They took less than 3 mins to quickly summarize ""Hammas Incursion"" (aka planned attacks with 5000+ rockets in less than a day). They were not done with the incursion but they also took civilians as hostage; I am sorry, any state that takes hostage is the definition of criminal abduction, and here we have monsters. Save yourself the history lesson. 

Hammas will cease to exist. Kidnappers here are monsters; they wanted to attack it should have been Israeli Army, you attack and kill babies, pets and take hostage; you are going to get a treatment which is not even required to be humane.. No humanity, no rights, no tolerance for such acts.. They are going to get killed.. no amount of media narrative will change that.

One more thing, bleep that message ""Allah hu Akbar""; Allah (saw) will kick them into oblivion.. if he finds their souls.. It's horrible these idiots say that; it's wrong; and that's why no Arab state is accepting war refugees.

Another point, Al Jazeera somehow seems to have more access to such proofs and videos.. and the quality of footage.. Drones, action cams.. Wait a moment, you have Hammas head too ?

Access to high-def footage of ""dead Hammas fighters"" from their phones, head cams and drones.. you are the front for Hammas Propoganda are you not ?

Just asking a question, seems logical. Very sober words used for an act which would drive chills through every normal person.

We are not happy about what's happening; we won't afford anyone the opportunity to repeat something like this. It's sad this has to happen, and if you folks had one gram of humanity you would not call them ""Hammas Fighters""; They're monsters.. and they are cowardly... even during WW2 you could see the enemy as Men who did wrong; here we have cowards who hide behind little girls.",0,0,2024-05-14T18:26:34Z,0

"I came across an interview with one of the makers of this doc with Peter Oborne he trying his best to minimise  the Israelis killed by the IDF on October 7th.   Basically a few were kill i.e. 17-28 by tanks, machine gun fire and from helicopter gunships, while Hamas killed  100s with lightly armed weapons and rpgs. I do not doubt Hamas et a;  kill 100s but i am convinced with the fire power used by the IDF they too kill 100s of their own people. Both sides were going round killing aimlessly with no leaders telling them what to do. Taking out 70 vehicles with Apache helicopters is a lot of  killing. So on average of 5 men and and a few  hostages i say about 2-3 hostages. That is roughly 560 at  8 people in the cars max, and about minimal 80 at 4 people per car. This just one episode the IDF did a lot more killing on that day as well as Hamas. Yes i believe Gazans and Hamas killed about 500+ but so did the Israelis.

"You are trying to distort reality and diminish what Hamas did on October 7th. On that day, between 2000 to 3000 terrorists and Gazan civilians entered Israel armed with Kalashnikov rifles, incendiary devices that burn everything, and RPGs with incendiary warheads. Yes, during October 7th, when our forces tried to fight thousands of terrorists, there were only a few incidents that we know of in which Israeli civilians might have been killed when tanks or helicopters fired on vehicles with terrorists returning to Gaza. It may sound strange to you that there are houses in kibbutzim that were hit by tank ammunition, there were isolated tanks that participated in the battles and when terrorists took cover in houses, it is clear that tanks were used to demolish them in 99 percent of cases when they realized there were no civilians. The case in Baari is the only case known in the IDF where civilians were probalay killed by tank shell fire, this is an event in which more than 14 civilians were held hostage by 40 terrorists who fired for hours without surrendering. The tank fired to the side of the house into a room where they estimated there were no hostages in order to allow forces to quickly enter the building. In interrogations, Hamas admitted that in certain kibbutzim...they were instructed to kidnap people and in other kibbutzim the goal was to kill as many civilians as possible. In relation to the Hannibal Procedure, a procedure that was canceled in recent years but always caused rough debate in Israeli society, There were people who supported it and others who opposed it. The procedure states that if a soldier is kidnapped, as a last resort it is preferable to act to stop the kidnapping even at the cost of harming the soldier rather than allowing the terrorists to kidnap the soldier. Gilad Shalit was released in exchange for 1,000 terrorists, hundreds of Jews were later killed in attacks carried out by those released terrorists, many of whom returned to carry out terrorism and joined Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Yahya Sinwar the leader of Hamas was one of those released. The idea behind the procedure is that the worst case scenario of losing a soldier is a kidnapped soldier, since this leads to the release of hundreds of terrorists who then go on to murder civilians and soldiers. To anyone who says that Hamas merely wanted to release Palestinian hostages, you are brainwashed. There are no Palestinian hostages in Israel, There are prisoners who carried out terrorist attacks or were arrested on their way to carry out a terror attack, some of them under the age of 18. Some of them are imprisoned by military order because Israel will not release to home a terrorist who wants to carry out a terror attack until all evidences will be collected, since it is reasonable that he will carry out a terror attack. To anyone who claims that Israel kills civilians in the West Bank. In the West Bank there are thousands of Hamas or Islamic Jihad terrorists. Most of the deaths in the westbank are terrorists that the army killed in exchange of fire. You claim there is settlers violence against Palestinians and that Israel builds walls or has checkpoints at crossings that make life difficult for Palestinian civilians, but you ignore the source of them. Israel suffers from ongoing terrorism originating from Judea and Samaria, there are hundreds of terror attempts of shootings, stabbings, rammings and bombings every year. In 1948 the Arabs started a civil war here, they killed Israeli civilians, Israel fought for its existence and yes, because of the war, Palestinians lost land and refugees were created who fled or were expelled during the war. In Gaza, 70 percent of the residents are refugees, have you asked yourselves why they live in refugee camps in their own country till this day? Why do the local Gazans treat them as second-class citizens? The answer is very simple: the Palestinians are a people who were created in order to resist the existence of the State of Israel. I believe that the local Arabs should have their own state, and if they want to identify themselves as Palestinians, that is their right. But on the other hand, they must recognize the existence of Israel and abandon terror. Israel was established after World War II, like many other countries in the Middle East.",0,1,2024-04-24T14:31:18Z,0

No.
Utterly biased and one-sided. It couldn‚Äôt have been more biased if it had been produced by Hamas itself. And maybe it was. 
Every single claim by Israel is quibbled with, picked apart, doubted, denied.
Every single claim by the Palestinians is presented as rock solid fact. Even though everyone is aware that these numbers and claims come straight from Hamas. 
No mention of the location or well-being of the hostages. No interviews with the families of the hostages.
This is 100% pure distilled propaganda, disguised as investigative journalism. Ominous music and spiffy graphics used to peddle the same tired BS. 
Here: let me save you an hour. Israel is bad and everything they say and do is evil. 
Palestinians are gentle peace loving people who are forced to occasionally do something objectionable because of those mean Israelis. They would never rape, except when they do. They would never kill children, except when they do kill children. They don‚Äôt target non combatants unless they are targeting non combatants.

Unfortunately, these innocent lives have been engulfed by the horrors and brutality of war. As they cry out in solitude, waiting for help and clinging to a thin thread of hope, we also join in solidarity by offering our prayers and strength to them. To be united with them, if not physically, then spiritually.

""The Lord is a refuge for the oppressed, a stronghold in times of trouble."" (Psalm 9:9)

It is in desperate times like this when the power of prayer is all the more important. For when we gather together in the Lord's name and seek His listening ear, miracles can happen. It is more than mere words, but a powerful offering of solidarity with the victims - those whose lives should never have been touched by the cruel actions that we witness right now in the media.

""He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart."" (Psalm 91:4)

Let us then, hand in hand, heart with heart, weave a world where no innocent soul feels the chill of war, where every life is sheltered, shielded, and delivered from despair. Father, we offer our prayers and actions in solidarity with the innocent victims of war.May your love and protection encompass them, delivering them from their tribulations.

"1: Comparison:
 
In the Srebrenica-Bosnian genocide, less than 10,000 were killed, whereas about 35,000 have been killed in Gaza so far.

In the Srebrenica-Bosnian genocide, most of those killed were men, unlike in Gaza, where 70% of those killed are children, women, and the elderly.
[Source: Israel Gaza: What Gaza‚Äòs death toll says about the war, BBC News.]

In the Srebrenica-Bosnian genocide, just a third as many people died as did in Gaza in terms of the percentage of the total population so far.
 
In the Srebrenica-Bosnian genocide, Serbs claimed to have perpetrated it to disarm Bosnian military men. Sound familiar?
 
In the international definition of genocide, it doesn‚Äôt matter if those who committed the genocide were provoked first.
 
More Palestinian children were killed in one week than Ukrainian children in one year.

2: Death Toll:
 
The Gaza Health Ministry is not controlled in any way by Hamas when it comes to estimates of the death toll.
Their figures from previous conflicts have lined up with figures from foreign, even western and American, counts.
 
The Gaza Health Ministry doesn‚Äôt have simple estimates, but it actually calculates the total death toll by counting each body delivered to hospitals and morgues.
It is an extremely high standard for death figures, one that certainly results in a figure that is much lower than the real figure.
 
The cause of lower figures is that during violent attacks like this:
There are always many dead who never make it to a hospital or a morgue and who aren‚Äôt found until much later.
There are some who don‚Äôt even have any family members left to report them missing.
 
The US Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs says that the death toll is ‚Äúvery possibly‚Äù much higher than being cited.
[Source: US official says Gaza death toll is believed to possibly be higher than claimed, Times of Israel.]
 
Only one of the five genocidal acts listed in the UN genocidal acts list of the UN Genocide Convention in Article II is related directly to killing (stipulation (a)), and meeting any of the 5 stipulations constitutes genocide.
A genocide doesn‚Äôt need high death counts.
 
3: Genocidal Acts:
3.1: Act 1, Bombing Civilian Buildings.
 
Israel grip over Gaza was always so complete, that it actually controls the Gaza Population Registry.
Meaning, when it strikes a residential building, it has a list of everyone who lives there.
It knows how many people, how many children, and how many elderly people could be killed or injured.
Then it bombs them anyway.
[source: The Population Registry, Gisha - Legal Center for Freedom of Movement]
 
As the trial for Srebrenica said:
‚ÄúThe offender is culpable because he knew or should have known that the act committed would destroy, in whole or in part, a group.‚Äù This wholly applies to Israel‚Äòs bombing.
 
After Israel destroyed and damaged 60% of Gaza‚Äôs buildings, it claimed that they killed 5,000 fighters.
 
That would have required that every military-aged man killed was a fighter, so it is clearly inflated.
 
Even if we assume 5,000 fighters was correct:
60% means 100,000 destroyed, 250,000 damaged, including 25,000 ‚Äòmilitary‚Äô targets.
All of those buildings for 5,000 fighters.
This is also all using the highest precision weapons worldwide.
 
With these numbers, it‚Äôs a more plausible assumption to say that Israel targets civilians and accidentally kills a fighter in the process, not vice versa.
 
The bombing against Germany during World War II destroyed just 45% of buildings over multiple years.
Gaza‚Äôs 60% was in 2 months, and the numbers now sre certainly far higher than before.
 
Many claim that Israel warning people to leave buildings before a bomb drops is a humane act. But‚Ä¶
This means any figters inside can leave too.
That leaves the only reason for the bombing:
Leaving nothing for Palestinians to return to after being exiled to Sinai.
More on population transfer later.
 
This shows that not only is the claim of bombing to kill Hamas fighters just irrelevant in whether a genocide is being perpetrated or not, but it is also blatantly false.
 
Israel bombed practically every square inch of North Gaza. It is absurd to say each building had a fighter.
 
Even killing a fighter in the bombing of a building is a war crime, as he would be off-duty.
An exception to this is commanders.
 
Israel posted a video of a strike on a church, claiming it was a Hamas militant center.
Later, they deleted all evidence from social media., and refused to comment on it in any way.
Hundreds of civilians and dozens of children were sheltering in the church at the time.
They knowingly lied about it being a Hamas center and tried to use it as media propaganda.
 
3.2: Act 2, Population Transfer:
 
An Israeli leaked document, confirmed as authentic by Israel, proposed to evacuate all 2.4 million Gazan Palestiniand via evacuation orders into tent cities that would be set up in the Sinai peninsula of Egypt.
It also explicitly states that the population will never be allowed to return.
[source: Israel Intelligence Ministry Policy Paper on Gaza‚Äôs Civilian Population, October 2023]
 
Israel‚Äôs acts show that these plans are being implemented.
 
Forcible transfer is a war crime, and would be considered within the context of a wider genicidal scheme.
 
Israel told 1.1 million North Gazans to evacuate south.
These are the types of threats used in the Srebrenica-Bosnian genocide:
Mrs. Camila Omanovic, a witness in the trial of General Krsti√©, recalled Mladic's words clearly:
""He said, ‚ÄòYou can go anywhere you want, or you can stay here or just vanish.‚Äô‚Äù
 
They are not humanitarian; they are threats designed to force native residents to leave.
This is a clear case of forced population transfer.
 
They bombed all the houses in the north en masse, ensuring that all those who evacuated had nothing to return to when they are eventually expelled to Sinai.
 
By November 23rd, around 1.7 million Palestinians, or 70% of the population of Gaza, were displaced.
The numbers are now certainly far higher.
 
These people are getting expelled, then getting expelled from where they were expelled multiple times.
 
Many who were being expelled were bombed on the way south.
This happened because Israel bombed the southern routes and 'safe zones‚Äô after telling the 1.1 million Palestinians to move south.
[Source: Israel told Palestinians to evacuate to southern Gaza and stepped up attacks there, NPR.] 
 
The zone will keep shrinking until they get expelled into Sinai.
 
This transfer of populations is also what happened in Srebrenica:
‚ÄúThe Trial Chamber provided sufficient reasoning for its conclusion that the suffering of the women, children, and elderly forcibly removed from Srebrenica amounted to serious mental harm under Article 4 of the Statute.""
Gaza‚Äòs situation is on a far larger scale than that of Srebrenica.

All the actions we went over correspond to sections (b) and (c) of the UN Genocide Convention list of genocidal acts in Article II:

‚Äú(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group‚Äù

‚Äú(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.‚Äù

In the UN Genocide Convention, meeting just any one of the 5 listed genocidal acts is enough to constitute genocide.

Well, the answer is simple..  4 arab countries attacked several times israel in order to innihilate it. 4 vs 1....  with an army of 1 million troop's all togather.. bigger then salah a din's great army. but god takes care of it's ppl, and israel won every single war.

"The whole thing was a setup. The right-wing Israeli government stated the partygoers and the kibbutz people because they were communists. They bitterly protested moving the party to the Gaza border. This move made the partygoers especially vulnerable to a Hamas attack the Israeli government anticipated for a year. Most of the civilians were incinerated, and their cars, over a hundred of them, were destroyed by heat from hellfire missiles. Damage to the residences was caused by heavy artillery and tank fire. Hamas had no Apache helicopters, hellfire missiles, or tanks. These cars and the near-cremated bodies inside were removed, and other cars were put back to replace them for photo ops. The Israeli military base overrun by Hamas had been evacuated prior to the attack, leaving only a few people sleeping in their bunks. The girls who operated the surveillance system were sacrificed and have since sued the Israeli government for incredible negligence, if not worse.

One story has Netanyahu supplying Hamas with arms. Hamas needs weapons to keep up the good fight, and Netanyahu needs an armed and aggressive enemy to justify Holocausting the Palestinians in Gaza. Of course, the IDF supplies the other side with weapons that they acquired from the US. If true, it sounds very profitable.",1,0,2024-03-28T22:09:35Z,0

"Another great piece by the Qatari government in support of the Palestinian cause masquerading as journalism. I watched this, because I wanted both sides of the story. I look at Jewish and Palestinian claims alike. This was one of the most biased documentaries I‚Äôve seen. Nothing like watching a BBC documentary. Rather, think of it like watching Fox News in support of Palestine (in the level of bias displayed). 

One thing I hated about this was that they take away the humanity of the Jewish victims. They blur out their faces, even when nothing graphic is being displayed, like, when the girl is kidnapped on the motorbike. Meanwhile, they rarely blur out Palestinian victims‚Äô faces. They want you to see the humanity there, as blood drips down the children‚Äôs faces. However, if it‚Äôs a Jewish victim, they blur out the face, stripping out one of the things that makes us so human

They spend five minutes showing what happened on October 7th, then the rest of it is spent propagating conspiracy theories about October 7th, denying that rape even occurred, or talking for 10 minutes on how the Israelis killed many of their own people, how they‚Äôre sooo barbaric for using something called the ‚ÄúHannibal protocol.‚Äù This protocol says it‚Äôs better to kill your own soldier, versus let him be kidnapped 

What a joke as well to start the documentary off with history reels describing how, ‚Äúthis began a long time before October 7th‚Äù 

Another great ‚ÄúPulitzer prize‚Äù winning documentary by Al Jazeera, if you read the comments. Rather, if you read the comments, in the few hours after it was published, you would‚Äôve seen how much open support there was for terrorism or violence against Jews, Israel or America.

As a Jew and Israeli passport holder who spent many years in the country and served in the IDF I have to say this is good documentary making and investigative journalism and is highly credible. As far as I am concerned I understand that Palestinians have a right to resist and have so little recourse to other possibilities that  it is almost impossible that such an action would not be brutal. If Israelis pretend they do not understand it is merely because they have chosen to ignore their own brutality.,469,47,2024-03-25T20:37:53Z,0

"Official data from the IDF shows that while the percentage of those who receive the exemption from conscription from among the secular and religious national youths is in a significant decrease, and the percentage of those who can be defined as evasions is generally negligible, the percentage of the ultra-Orthodox exemption recipients is stable, and is even expected to increase. The data is contained in a document of the Research and Information Center of The Knesset published last week. The center distributed a document on the implementation of the Tal Law, which is based on data presented by the Personnel Division at the General Staff also before the Plesner Committee to examine the change in the recruitment model.

According to the research center, the recruitment rate of 18-year-old Jewish men in 2011 was about 75%. Among the 25% of the yearbook members who were not recruited, 13% are ultra-Orthodox youth who were denied service for the reasons of ""Torah and His Holiness"". The rate of these was only 8.4% of the yearbook in 2004. It jumped to a rate of 13% in 2009 and has been stable since then, although the forecasts of the Personnel Division of the General Staff hold that without a change in the recruitment arrangements, there will be a further increase in the rate of Haredim exempted from service. , in the corresponding years there was a real change in the proportion of non-Orthodox recipients of the exemption. In 2005 their proportion was 14.8% of the year, in 2007 their proportion rose to a peak of 16.3% and in 2011 the proportion of exemption recipients dropped to a relative low of 12.1% of the year.",0,0,2024-03-25T18:57:08Z,0

"Nothing in this documentary changes my opinion of Hamas and the events of October 7th. The events of October 7th transpired because Hamas attached Israel and targeted innocent civilians, as evidenced by the hundreds of deceased at the music festival and the targeting of settlements. Plus, there are the thousands of unguided rockets launched against Israel from the Gaza Strip and the taking of hundreds of hostages, many of whom have died during their captivity. 

Hamas used the Gaza Strip as a training base and staged the attacks from within its borders. Hamas won the last round of elections held within Gaza back in 2006. There is popular support within the Arab population for Hamas, including the diversion of funds to build tunnels and purchase arms, the excavation of water lines to support the manufacture of rockets, and the glorification of deceased terrorists and martyrs. Hamas is representative of the Arab populations is the same way the Nazis were representative of the Germans during WW II.   Thus, Israel is justified in waging total war against Hamas and the Arabs the same way that the Allies were justified in waging total warfare against Germany, Japan, and Italy during WW II. Even the leader of Hamas views the destruction of Gaza as being worthwhile because it advances the Arab cause, a cause marked by insanity and barbarism.",1,1,2024-03-24T21:03:03Z,0

Israel has created its own 'Zone of Interest' next to its Gaza Strip concentration camp,3,0,2024-03-23T11:51:15Z,0
"Why Israel helped create Hamas
Since the founding of Hamas in 1987, Israeli, American and Palestinian officials have repeatedly acknowledged that Israel did indeed help create and fund the Islamist group.

The point made by many of these officials is not that Israel ‚Äúallowed‚Äù the rise of Hamas or that Hamas emerged in response to Israeli ‚Äúoccupation‚Äù of Palestine. Rather, their point was and is that Israel‚Äôs intelligence agencies actively helped create and finance the Hamas group.

As the officials cited below make clear, the overall goal of supporting Hamas has been to thwart the creation of a Palestinian state and avert the implementation of a two-state solution to the Palestine question. From Israel‚Äôs perspective, a two-state solution would reduce Israel‚Äôs territory to the internationally recognized pre-1967 borders, prohibit any future territorial expansion, and prevent the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel‚Äôs capital city.

More specifically, supporting the Islamist Hamas group has served several Israeli objectives at once: first, it undermined Yasser Arafat‚Äôs secular nationalist PLO; second, it helped prevent the implementation of the 1993 Oslo Accords; third, it undermined the Palestinian National Authority and isolated Gaza from the Westbank; fourth, it impeded Western support for the Palestinian cause; and fifth, it justified Israeli (counter-)attacks on Palestinian territory.

In other words, by secretly supporting a group that does not recognize the existence of the state of Israel and does not accept a two-state solution, Israel does not have to accept the existence of a Palestinian state and does not have to support a two-state solution, either.

It is sometimes argued that while Israel initially supported the creation of Hamas, the Islamist group got out of control and Israeli officials came to regret their support (the ‚Äúblowback theory‚Äù).

While this is certainly true for some Israeli officials and for the Israeli population affected by Hamas rockets and terrorist attacks, it is not true for Israeli grand strategists, as the quotes below make clear: for them, Hamas has continued to serve its intended purpose even after the Oslo Accords in 1993 and after Israel‚Äôs withdrawal from the Gaza Strip in 2005.

For the grand strategists, the presence of Hamas in the remaining Palestinian territories might provide, one day, the necessary pretext for a ‚Äúfinal solution‚Äù to the Palestinian question.",1,0,2024-03-23T11:33:29Z,0

Who knows where the footage actually came from, (the Israelis are round-the-clock fabricators), or what else Israel is hiding. 

Sanders maintains most of the killing was from Hamas or Palestinian militants. Personally, I reserve judgement until a full, independent investigation is undertaken, which we all know Israel is never going to permit.

"Last weekend I woke up to beautiful sunlight and the sounds of birds and wildlife anyone who lives in the Territory knows well.

But I hadn‚Äôt slept well. I couldn‚Äôt.

I was haunted by images of gunmen in my garden, attacking my husband and children while they watched morning TV. I could hear screaming and felt a sense of horror, picturing them turning their weapons towards me.

I was imagining these awful things because I had just arrived home from a visit to Israel, where I visited the Kibbutz that was the site of the Hamas massacre on October 7 last year.

The things I imagined were the things that happened to Israelis in that Kibbutz on that terrible day.

I was shown footage from mobile phones, car dash cams, CCTV and the body-worn cameras of Hamas terrorists.

Footage of things that I will never be able to forget. 

This was a terrorist attack that defies belief and rationality.

These fanatics are not interested in peace or a two-state solution. They want to kill and destroy Jews. That‚Äôs it.

It‚Äôs plain to see, and that leads to the other thing that haunts me.

That here in our Australian cities we had people praising the attacks.

We had marches in the streets about glorifying the ‚Äúmartyrs‚Äù of Hamas.

It didn‚Äôt even take people ‚Äì including left-wing activists in the Greens ‚Äì 48 hours after October 7 to start protesting against Israel, who had just had over a thousand of their citizens murdered.

It‚Äôs astonishing and, dare I say it, scary for that to happen on our own shores.

Hamas relies on the support of gullible western activists to provide cover for their terror campaigns and there are many in Australia who are only too happy to give it to them.

In fact, it seems some of them are not gullible but willing.

I‚Äôve written this week in The Australian about my visit to Israel not only to reiterate the evil done against Israel but also to express my disappointment that we‚Äôre still waiting on Prime Minister Albanese to show the leadership we‚Äôve seen from other country‚Äôs leaders and actually visit Israel.

It is time for the Prime Minister to make clear beyond doubt the commitment of Australia to our only democratic partner in the Middle East, to peace in the region and our advocacy for the return of every hostage taken on October 7.",1,3,2024-03-22T10:33:42Z,0

But I was so far removed from it, and then 9/11 happened, so my sympathy for the Middle East as a whole became nonexistent. Then life happened and I wasn‚Äôt paying much attention to international news. It took the events after 10/7 for me to start to look into what has been happening there. It‚Äôs so blatantly obvious to me, that the Western world as a whole has been lied to for decades and decades! To see the indiscriminate bombing with absolutely no sympathy to the death of innocence, how can anyone with eyes and a brain not see what‚Äôs going on here? They are liars and bad liars at that! I think at the highest levels, the Israeli government let October 7th happen, they stood the military down to let bad things happen. Then when they didn‚Äôt think the things were bad enough, they made up awful stories to dehumanize the Palestinians, so they could completely wipe Gaza off the map!

"There‚Äôs no doubt that Hamas committed atrocities. It‚Äôs horrible. It‚Äôs inconceivable‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt justify the carnage & barbarism that Israel has committed since. Also, it‚Äôs ironic that Israelis or the IDF has created a website to document the crimes of OCT 7 w/ graphic photos & videos bc more than 60% of those images/videos show burned & charred bodies‚Ä¶ which was not done by hamas‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt need to exaggerate the horrors that were inflicted onto the Israeli ppl‚Ä¶ what happened is already atrocious enough‚Ä¶. So why do they keep making things up if for no other purpose than to justify their genocidal intent that has been prevalent since. But passing off your war crimes as if they were done by the other side somehow makes all of this even more horrifying. Especially when most of those crimes were committed against your own civilians. Not to mention using the murder of innocent women to manipulate the narrative in order to get ‚Äúfeminists‚Äù to believe your lies & then getting mad at them when they don‚Äôt (bc there wasn‚Äôt any evidence) ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs an even more ridiculous & disgusting layer to this that didn‚Äôt need to exist. I don‚Äôt doubt that there was some form of sexual violence on October 7th‚Ä¶ idk by who, idk who it was against but I‚Äôm not closing the door on the possibility of that happening‚Ä¶ but again, the atrocities were horrifying enough‚Ä¶ making up crimes that didn‚Äôt happen just to get ppl to support your deliberate ethnic cleansing campaign is so disturbing‚Ä¶. Tricking ppl into celebrating the death of nearly 40,000 ppl, most of which were innocent women & children is so messed up. We can condemn what Hamas did (which I do) & have sympathy for the Israeli ppl &  also stand up against more unnecessary violence & war crimes. One doesn‚Äôt cancel out the other. Just like Zionism, Israeli & Jew are not interchangeable words. To conflate them is doing a disservice to the Jewish ppl & creating more antisemitism. We need to stop the violence & mass killing. It‚Äôs all wrong. No matter who is perpetrating it. Nobody gets a free pass to mass murder anyone else. Period.",1,0,2024-03-21T05:22:30Z,0

"Good overall as an introduction to October 7th, but Al Jazeera does no one any favors by ignoring the other 11 Palestinian resistance groups besides Hamas that participated on October 7th.

Also, because it was a collective action, not all of the fighting groups were as highly trained and disciplined as Hamas.  As with any 'volunteer' organization, it can get a bit chaotic.

"Firstly, Palestinian ""prisoners"" are illegally imprisoned hostages. They are kidnapped, among them hundreds of children, and imprisoned without legal proceedings as you would in a criminal court, then tortured, with many dying in decades long incarceration. ""Prisoner"" is an intentional misnomer by Israel to mislead others as to why Palestinians are imprisoned. They have written poems on social media, they are teenagers posting pictures of flags.¬†

Secondly, you are correct that Israel did fire on Israelis and murder many of them. There are videos of Israelis themselves (who were not taken to Ghaza) telling of such and describing the actions both of the militants and of the IDF. I watched two of these, and they had described balanced accounts of how militants killed a male, left the rest alive and unharmed. In one of these, they then described that Israeli forces opened fire on them all and killed all the Israeli hostages on site. 

Thirdly, as for that Israeli at 48:07. He is not credible. He changed his story in different interviews and he describes he saw a rape from his hiding place, where they did not catch him and his friends. He shows a film from his phone of the location of the ""rape"" in his film footage at the time, yet there was no one in that film. He describes he saw a knife among rapists around a girl from an impossible distance, one which his phone could have filmed, yet didn't. From someone who was hiding from armed killers in his small group in the bushes, it's odd he held up his phone to film militants' location (which contained no one at all), was close enough to see a knife from a distance from which was impossible to see a knife, and survived without being discovered himself. The guy takes film footage of his fellow hiders in the shallow bushes as they flee for their lives yet hold up a phone on themselves, yet nothing and no one else appear on film, or anything from Oct. 7. It's as if he got a few people and hid in some bushes and waved his phone around months after the fact. The timing of his film footage appearing on Youtube was very very late.¬†Whereas the Israelis who described their encounters with militants appeared instantly online.¬†
There was another ""rape"" description by a female who said she saw people raping a girl from her vantage point on the ground. Yet she was neither found, kidnapped, raped, or killed as she supposedly watched this happening. Rape is likely to happen in situations like this, but Israel hasn't taken forensic evidence, did not allow independent international investigators, and is not credible. It was bent on hiding its own Hannibal murders of Israelis and investigating rape was not on its agenda. I would not believe any scene in the hands of Israel at this point as they would contaminate it. If it did happen, a lot of them and the perpetrators are dead, which is more than punishment in a court of law. Israel is saying assault is occurring in Ghaza among hostages yet no returned hostages have claimed such. 

Fourthly, most of Israel serves in the army. And when you take off your uniform and play civilian you are still an IDF soldier who will return every year for miluim, or an ex soldier post duty. And they can refuse the army, and spend some months in jail.",0,0,2024-03-21T00:36:59Z,0

"Max Blumental and Aaron Mate at the Grayzone, along with the Electronic Intefada and Mondoweiss debunked the lies and ""atrocity propaganda"" coming out of Israel by their media and parroted by the useful Idiots in the MSM and outlets like the NYT long before any other institutions. Congratulations to Max Blumental on his recent Journalism Award for his work! 

The Israeli state has all the indicators of fascism, and J Liebowitz the man who Isaiah Berlin called "".. The conscience of Israel."" predicted what it has become!  

Hannah Arendt, James Cohen, James Luther Adams, Vasily Grossman, Primo Levy all warned us that fascism and it's faces are savage and brutal and it requires eternal vigilance to prevent it's scourge from rising up as the line between the victimiser and the victim is razor thin and thus the capacity to become the victimiser resides potentially in all once fascism takes hold! Shalamov and Primo Levy got it....

 Susan Sontag wrote.. 10%of a population are merciful no matter what, 10% are cruel no matter what and the remaining 80%can be moved in either direction.... Propaganda does this! The lies, manipulations and misinformations/disinformation deliberately spread are such powerful tools, and spread so easily by skillful liars in "" state information beureaus and Psyoperators in government circles;"" and by pernicious actors in the digital age!

An occupying power has no right to self-defense against the occupied.

Israel is officially an occupying power and its presence in the Palestinian territories is illegal under UN Security Council Resolution 242 (1967). Consequently, resistance to this Israeli occupation is legal. General Assembly Resolution 45/130 (1990) gives the Palestinians the right to resist ""by all means at their disposal, including armed struggle.""
It is precisely for this reason that Russia, before its intervention in Ukraine on February 21, recognized the independence of the Donbas republics. This made it possible for these two republics to ask Russia for help in launching a defensive war under Article 51 of the Charter against the incipient Ukrainian offensive. I had described this mechanism in my books on the Ukraine conflict and in your journal ""Current Affairs in Focus"". 
If, ironically, Israel were to recognize the existence of a Palestinian state, it could wage a defensive war against it. Israel's internationally recognized status, however, is that of an occupying power, and as such, it is its responsibility to protect the Palestinian population, not to destroy it.",1,0,2024-03-20T16:25:42Z,0

Israel's presence and control outside of its 1948 mandated borders or even its 1967 borders is toxic and without solution. The world has largely ignored this reality or made nonserious efforts to address it. There will ever be  atrocities on both sides while Israel remains outside of its own mandated land, and this includes control of the sort exercised before October 7th. The international community must establish a Palestinian state or at least a protectorate with the goal of sovereignty that has no control by Israel.",0,0,2024-03-20T15:48:36Z,0

"We need a true documentary. Without suspenseful music and that strictly follows the timeline and identifies every image shown like it is made for a trial. It may be 3hours long‚Ä¶ so what. Without any government cooperation from any country, this could be propaganda too. Not everyone searches to listen to any and all hostages that give their account of treatment.. they were scared but at most? They were BORED. At worst? They were fleeing a building being bombed by Israel. Perhaps the embarrassment of blowing away and therefore killing and charring their own people‚Ä¶ whether on purpose and without regard or through (likely a combination) a sloppy military defense (not to mention genuine fear from BULLIES that are not use to their victims fighting back, those of which have genuine motivation to fight that Israel lacked).

 Also the claim that a proportion of the dead on Oct 7th were unarmed Israeli civilians, certainly not arguing that wasn't true in some cases but we've all seen footage of Israeli settlers threatening Palestinians with guns when they steal land and build illegal settlements whilst IDF ""soldiers"" stand idly by. So I would hazard a guess, not all were unarmed, especially the ones shooting back at Hamas gunmen in the kibbutz shown in the footage.

 I wonder if we'll ever know what proportion of Israelis were killed by Hamas on October the 7th and what proportion were killed by IDF pilots firing indiscriminately and random vehicles and pedestrians. I fear more were killed by the latter under the Hannibal protocol.",1,1,2024-03-20T14:08:44Z,0

"Sad to see people killing each other with guns, bombs and knives, yet they have brains to engage meaningfully to minimise bloodshed. Having studied these conflict from as far as 1948, there are key things that are an obstacle to peace: 1. The Right Wing in Israel say NO to a Palestinian State 2. The extreme side of Palestinians want to eradicate the Jewish state  - ""From the river to the sea"". With this, we will not have peace or a Palestinian state. The other thing one should question is why are Arab countries showing little interest on the matter? The answer might be their economic interests. War on its own is ugly and we should exercise restraint not to start it. Every war will claim women, children, the innocent and infrastructure as its collateral. Lamenting for such becomes a way to justify further aggression as we see in this conflict. It is now a war of attrition until Hamas surrenders or they are too exhausted to fight.

"I think that Isreal has the right to exist. The Osmanian empire lost the second world war on the side of the Nazis and mainly fought against British and Australien forces. The British were just beginning to evolve away from colonialism. It is perfectly acceptable that the winning side of a just war can decide what to do with their newly conquered land. The anti colonial stance was mainly driven by the American enlightenment. But superior ethics does not do away with the rights of the winning side. Otherwise we would not honor the virtue of returning the loser to his sovereignty if it was a given. All states go back to moments like this. No land is owned without a conquering in its past. Therefore Israel has just the right to exist as any other state. 

The *Gazan*/Palestinian are very unreasonable about this. They are funded unnaturally by foreign interest, which are based on religious fanaticism and hatred of jews. This state is left to self govern and a religious terrorist group has taken over. Killing politicians and brainwashing children for decades. I don't see how this can be tolerated by an overarmed semi-democracy. This is defiantly preprogrammed to happen and I think that the people who fund this disaster are either ignorant or willing to play with human lives out of religious delusions. 

Charity can make the world a worse place if you dont think critically of where it is going. Many dictators have been funded by playing to the emotions of distant people. Maybe there should be so many people in Gaza in the first place. Maybe they should build a real economy based on tourism or maybe minerals in their costline. Instead they are a over funded meat shield to stupid terror groups from the middle ages.",1,0,2024-03-20T12:17:15Z,0

So when you're comparing ages and towns this just doesn't mean anything.  You have to compare age to PLACE AND MANNER OF DEATHS. Thank you for your consistency!
All Kibbutz are ties communities and know each other. Especially on Saturday + Jewish Holliday of Simhat Torah, there were a lot a families and children sleeping and visiting families in kibbutz that are not their permanent place of living.
About  the family of 4 killed at 42:00 , again the ages are estimations, there are at least two families that were decimated on Oct 7th:
The Family Sharabi and the Family Kedem Siman Tov. you're invited to check the ages and the circumstances of deaths.
BTW, not only with names you can recheck infos for example:
A couples that is not married though living under the same house have different names, and if for example the child has invited a friend to sleep at home, and all of them murdered in the same house next to each other, they'll seem like a family but they are not recognizable as such i. the list of casualties.
I'm not saying all of what you're saying is false, I'm saying that you pick the most little doubt about information without even trying to dig dipper.",0,0,2024-03-20T11:15:57Z,0
